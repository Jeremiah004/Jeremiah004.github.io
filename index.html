            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
            <p>Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn, achieving an accuracy of 85%. Utilized Pandas and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model training. 
            </p>
        
            <h3>Brain Tumor Detection</h3>
            <p>Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow to look for tumors in the brains of patients without the use of a radiologist.</p>
        
            <h3>Text Classification using DistilBERT</h3>
            <p>Built a model that classifies text based on the characters present in them using DistilBERT. Utilized transfer learning and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy.</p>
    

            <h3>Stock Price Prediction</h3>
            <p>Developed a logistic regression model to predict stock prices. Used historical stock data and various technical indicators to train the model.</p>
        
            <h3>Large Language Model</h3>
            <p>Created a large language model that runs locally on your system, capable of generating coherent text and performing various NLP tasks.</p>

            <h3>Blogging app</h3>
            <p>I built an app using flask for writing blogs and sending messages to others</p>
